# YACLL
Yet Another C Like Language

## Requirements

1. flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator)

2. bison (GNU parser generator, yacc-compatible)

3. gcc (GNU C Compiler)

4. POSIX-compatible operating system (do we need this, are we building in VMs? or does this work on Windows?)

## Build Instructions

Run the command below to execute the Makefile.
```Shell
make yapl
```

## Test Instructions

The file lex_test.c has a few test functions that uses all possible tokens in YACLL to test the lexer. It can be executed with the following command.
```Shell
./yapl lex_test.c
```

## Important Files

### yapl.h
Do we need to add this? Or is it auto-generated?

### yapl.l
This is the lex specification file. It defines token patterns using regular expressions and specifies which token corresponds to which pattern. The types of tokens are keywords, numbers, identifiers, operators, comments and ...

### yapl.y
This is the yacc specification file. It defines the grammar of the language, i.e., how the tokens fit together syntactically.

### lex.yy.c
This is a file generated by the command `flex yapl.l`. It contains C code that implements the lexer.
